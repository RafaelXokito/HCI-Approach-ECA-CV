\section{Introduction}

Empathy, which entails comprehending and sharing others' emotions to forge emotional connections, is vital for human relationships. Similarly, in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), empathy is crucial in ensuring more realistic, improved, convenient and meaningful interactions. However, the typical HCI, aimed at tailoring computer systems to meet the specific needs and preferences of individuals, still lacks the users' emotional state, therefore losing crucial information during these interactions \cite{jaiswal_facial_2020}.  Recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, such as Emotion Recognition (ER) and empathic Conversational Agents (CAs), when integrated with HCI allow for continuous understanding of the user's emotions throughout interactions and empathically providing responses, greatly contribute to an increase in the quality and deepness of interactions between humans and computers, improving the user's overall experience \cite{santos_approaches_2018}.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) encompasses various techniques and methodologies aimed at enabling machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, whereas Deep Learning (DL) stands out as a specialized approach relying on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to process unstructured data (including images, voice, videos, and text, among others). ER, being a recent application of AI combined with DL, involves detecting human emotions through various modalities ranging from facial features, gestures, and poses, to speech and text captured through continuous interactions with the user \cite{alrowais_modified_2023}.  CAs consist of computer programs designed to simulate human-like conversation and engage in interactions with users through natural language using various techniques, including natural language processing (NLP), ML, and DL, to understand user input, interpret context, and generate appropriate responses.
 
Due to the immense potential of ER and CA, individually, and the numerous benefits provided when integrated with HCI, this study offers a comprehensive guide covering ER modalities and key design and functionality aspects of a CA, furthermore reviewing widely adopted datasets and methodologies. Lastly, proposing an innovative HCI approach to ensure more realistic and meaningful interactions by leveraging HCI in conjunction with ER techniques and an empathic CA.
 
The primary findings of this study can be summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Detailed guide on how DL impacts HCI nowadays;
	\item Performed a literature review regarding ER and CAs;
	\item Explored the main methods and datasets used for ER and CAs;
	\item Proposal of a taxonomy encompassing HCI, DL, CA, and ER;
	\item Proposal of an architecture of an HCI approach aided with ER, through Computer Vision (CV) and Sentiment Analysis (SA), and emphatic CA.
\end{itemize}

This research is organized into six sections. Section \ref{sec:background} presents the main concepts behind DL, ER, and CA. Section \ref{sec:datasets} details the most used datasets to train, validate, and evaluate ER and CA algorithms. Section \ref{sec:methods} introduces and discusses the core AI algorithms used nowadays to build ER systems and CAs, while Section \ref{sec:solution} presents the architecture, features, and characteristics of our proposed solution for HCI aided with ER and an empathic CA. Lastly, Section \ref{sec:conclusions}  introduces the challenges and directions for future work and the conclusions.
