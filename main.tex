\section{Introduction}
 
%Research topics:
%• Human-Computer Interaction (HCI):
%◦ Explainable Deep Learning in HCI (explain how HCI and DL crossed paths using
%Chatto’s paper)
%◦ Emotion Recognition (Face, Pose, Text, Speech, Methods, Datasets)
%◦ Conversational Agents (Embodied, Interaction, Domain, Goal, Methods, Datasets)
%◦ Application: Proposed architecture/solution
%Contributions:
%1. Explanation of how Deep Learning impact HCI nowadays
%2. A brief review of Emotion Recognition and Conversational agents topics
%3. Exposure of the main used methods and datasets used for emotion recognition and
%conversational agents
%4. A proposal of a taxonomy regarding HCI, DL, CA, and ER.
%5. The proposal of an architecture of a Human Computer Interaction approach with an Empathic Conversational Agent and Computer Vision
%Results/Prototype characteristics:
%1. Multi-modal CA able to recognize and monitor older adults’ emotions through pose, and face features along with text and speech captured from interactions.
%2. CA able to aid older adults in regulating and counterbalancing negative emotions while maintaining positive emotions positive.
